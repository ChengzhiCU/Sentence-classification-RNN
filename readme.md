The processing of the sentence, word embedding, are in files datasetgen*.py,genGlove50embed.py.

The main codes LSTM, Bilateral LSTM, Skip LSTM, ESN, RNN, not sharing parameters RNN,for our recurrent layer are in layer.py

Thanks teaching assistant Yulong Wang for his well organized code architecture,
we develop our project based on his previous code for our homework.

All the additional code are written by us.
